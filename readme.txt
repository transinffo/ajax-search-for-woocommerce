== Description ==

The most popular **WooCommerce product search plugin**. It gives your users a well-designed advanced AJAX search bar with live search suggestions.

By default, WooCommerce provides a very simple search solution, without live product search or even SKU search. FiboSearch (formerly Ajax Search for WooCommerce) provides advanced search with live suggestions.

Who doesn’t love instant, as-you-type suggestions? In 2025, customers expect smart product search. Baymard Institute’s latest UX research reveals that search autocomplete, auto-suggest, or an instant search feature **is now offered on 96% of major e-commerce sites**. It's a must-have feature for every online business that can’t afford to lose customers. Why? FiboSearch helps users save time and makes shopping easier. As a result, Fibo really boosts sales.
